= Color

If you're starting from scratch without a brand guideline, choose a primary and/or accent color that suits your design's mood or tone. Lumo defaults to blue, a common yet neutral and safe choice. If you opt for green or red, be mindful as they're often tied to success and error messages. Meanwhile, purple and vibrant gradients have gained popularity in AI branding and design.

== Generating a Color Palette

If you need help generating a color palette, there are many great tools available online. For example:

* https://colors.eva.design/

Lumo's <<{articles}/styling/lumo/lumo-style-properties/color#,color palette>> consists of grayscale shades, blue (as the primary color), red (for errors), green (for success), yellow (for warnings), and text colors.

We recommend following the "less is more" approach when using color in your app. Limiting your color palette to a few strategic choices—such as one primary color, a couple of accent shades, and neutral tones—helps create a clean, cohesive interface. This reduces visual clutter and ensures that important elements stand out. So keep it simple for a more intuitive and focused user experience.


== Color Contrast

Ensure there is sufficient contrast between the text and its background. For legibility purposes, you should target a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, in accordance with https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum:[WCAG 1.4.3]. Today, most browsers feature a built-in color contrast checker that can be accessed through the inspection tools.

// TODO Why is this in quotes?

“Lumo/Aura is compliant by default, but if you customize the text colors, be sure to check the contrast.”

For large text (18pt or 14pt bold), the contrast ratio should be at least 3:1. At a resolution of 96 DPI, 1pt is approximately 1.333px, meaning 18pt is about 24px and 14pt is about 19px.

Avoid relying on color alone to convey information, as outlined in https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color[WCAG 1.4.1]. Use text labels, patterns, or shapes in addition to colors to ensure accessibility.
