= Security Considerations

Control Center is a powerful tool that simplifies the management of Vaadin applications on Kubernetes clusters. However, it's essential to consider security when deploying and using Control Center. This page outlines best practices to ensure your applications and data are secure.


== Cluster-Wide Admin Privileges

During installation, Control Center requires cluster-wide admin privileges to manage resources across namespaces. This is necessary for Control Center to deploy and manage applications, services, and other resources in your cluster.

However, granting these privileges can pose a security risk. To mitigate this risk, you can install Control Center's dependencies manually. This way, you can limit the permissions granted to Control Center and reduce the potential impact of a security breach.
