Theme Editor allows to choose scope of changes, Local - for given component only, Global - for all components of given type.

=== Local

In Local mode, Theme Editor uses unique class name to distinguish picked component.
If there is none existing yet, Theme Editor suggests new.

[NOTE]
Class name is applied to component using `addClassName` method call with `<theme-editor-local-classname>` annotation.
Theme Editor will lose track of component if modified manually.

=== Global

In Global mode, Theme Editor writes CSS rules that are applicable to all components of given type.

[NOTE]
Local rules have priority over Global rules.

== Styling Component Elements

=== Slider

User can also use custom values not handled by slider.

== Code Generation

Theme Editor saves CSS rules into `theme-editor.css` within current theme directory.

[NOTE]
Manual modifications of `theme-editor.css` will be processed by Theme Editor and may be formatted accordingly.

== Limitations

As it is free developer preview, there are still some limitations:

- manual modification of Java classes without build and deploy (hot deployment) results in Theme Editor not be able to pick some components
- support for Variants (like Primary button) must be added manually
