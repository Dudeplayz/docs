= Getting Started with AI Form Filler

Form Filler is implemented as an addon. To use it you need to add the Maven dependency to your project. 

[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.vaadin.flow.ai</groupId>
            <artifactId>form-filler-addon</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
----

If you prefer to first test the addon with an example see https://github.com/vaadin/form-filler-demo[demo project]. Also, some demos and advanced example use cases are included in the https://github.com/vaadin/form-filler-addon[addon project]. 

In the demo project, you can see an example of all of the supported components, with some raw text sources included. In the addon project, you'll find some experiments with more advanced use cases like document inputs through optical character recognition (OCR). New content and examples -- such as using other LLM models than ChatGPT or improving OCR results -- could be included in the addon project in the future. 

To run demos or use the addon out of the box in your application you need a valid ChatGPT API Key. This key can be set as environment variable or specified as a JVM property with the `-D` flag. The name of the variable is `OPENAI_TOKEN`.

For Mac OS, include on your [filename]`.zprofile`:

[source,script]
----
export OPENAI_TOKEN="THE KEY"
----

For Windows, go to "System &rarr; Advanced Settings &rarr; Set Environment Variables" to set `OPENAI_TOKEN` and `GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY`.


== Example

To understand how the Form Filler works, take a look to this example:

[source,java]
----
@Route("test")
public class FormTest extends Div {

    public FormTest() {

        TextField nameField = new TextField("Name");
        nameField.setId("name");

        TextField addressField = new TextField("Address");
        addressField.setId("address");

        FormLayout fl = new FormLayout();
        fl.add(nameField, addressField);

        FormFiller formFiller = new FormFiller(fl);
        formFiller.fill("My name is Bart and I live at 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield USA");

        add(fl);
    }
}
----

To enable the Form Filler, there is only one requirement. You have to set meaningful IDs to the `fields(Components)` that you want Form Filler to fill. The target can be one component, or a group of components (container). Normally, one would use the Form Filler with a Form Layout. However, any kind of Layout may be used.
